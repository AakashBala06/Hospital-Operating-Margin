README – Hospital Operating Margin Model (Introductory Project)

Project Summary:
This is an introductory-level healthcare finance project focused on understanding how payer mix affects a hospital's operating margin. The model was created using Microsoft Excel to calculate net revenue, cost per encounter, and operating margin across different payer types and departments.

Data Disclaimer:
The raw data used in this model was generated by AI and is entirely fictitious. It does NOT reflect actual hospital data or financial records. All payer types, reimbursement values, and cost assumptions were created for demonstration purposes only.

Purpose:
This project is intended for learning and portfolio development. It demonstrates foundational financial modeling concepts in a healthcare context and should not be used for real-world decision-making, operations, or strategic planning.

Key Features:
- Department-level cost assumptions
- Payer-level reimbursement calculations
- Operating margin computation
- Summary table of profitability by payer and department

Limitations:
- Data is synthetic and not validated
- No real hospital systems or patient data were used
- Results should not be used for academic, clinical, or business decisions
